I would like to build a jukebox app that generates a custom playlist based on how a user is feeling when they wake up. Each morning the user would log their mood(e.g, energized,relaxed, ererie, sad). The app would generate a playlist based on the selected mood mixing songs, sounds, beeats that match the vibe the user is going for. User can keep a journal od their past moods with a playlist attached to the entry. Also, allows for users to send their mood playlists to freinds or discover other mood playlis.

 Notes

One challange I encountered while building the app was understanding the interface, I was able to complete with ease once i explored the interface more.
